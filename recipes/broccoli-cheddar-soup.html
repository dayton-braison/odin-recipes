    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>yellow onion</li>
        <li>broccoli</li>
        <li>carrots</li>
        <li>celery</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>chicken broth</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>smoked paprika</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>sharp cheddar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onion. Chop the broccoli into very small pieces. Peel and slice the carrots.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and onion to a large soup pot and sauté over medium until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the
        flour and continue to sauté for about 2 minutes more, or until the flour is coating the bottom of the pot and is a light
        golden brown color.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and whisk to dissolve all the flour off the bottom of the pot. Turn the heat up to medium-high
        and, while stirring often, allow the broth to come up to a simmer. When it reaches a simmer it will thicken to a gravy
        consistency.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat back down to medium and whisk in the milk, smoked paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne
        pepper. Allow the broth to come back up to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped broccoli and carrots, allow the broth to come back up to a simmer, and continue to simmer the
        vegetables, stirring often, for 15 minutes, or until the carrots are tender.</li>
        <li>Finally, turn the heat down to medium-low and stir the shredded cheese into the soup, one handful at a time, until it is
        fully melted. Taste the soup and add salt if needed.</li>
    </ol>
